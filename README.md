# Astrogarbage Collectors

Multiplayer coop game in which you and your friends have to destroy as much asteroids and satellites as you can in the given time<br>
Made as a solo project in summer 2024, developed in ~3 weeks

## What did I learn/practice?

<ul>
<li>Multiplayer in Unreal Engine entirely in C++ (Gameplay framework, Replication, RPC, Relevancy, Session, ...)</li>
<li>Creation and management of Modules and Plugins for clean and decoupled architecture</li>
<li>Clean UI programming in C++</li>
<li>Integration with FMOD for SoundFX</li>
<li>Complete C++ project (except some VFX in Blueprint) with vanilla Visual Studio 2022 (I used Rider for the previous project, with VS I learned many more things that Rider hide and oversimplified)</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Tools programming for simplifying logging and module creation</li>
</ul>
